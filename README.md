## File storage

First we create a storage account fill in the basic data (subscription, resource group name, resource name, region) and deploy the storage

Once the resource has been created, we go to the shared resources section, we create a shared resource, giving it the desired name and the required access level.

We enter the resource that we just created and upload the file that we want, select the connect section and copy the marked text to consequently go to powershell and paste the copied text and with that we will have a file storage in all the machines that have a permission
